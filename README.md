# Device Comparison Tool (Comparator)

This project aims to provide a tool for comparing different types of devices so that users can make informed decisions based on their preferences. The tool can be used to compare a wide range of products, including :

Vehicles (cars, trucks, motorcycles)
Electronics (phones, tablets, TVs)
Appliances (refrigerators, washing machines, etc.)

To use the tool, simply select the type of device you want to compare and enter the relevant information for each product.
<!-- The tool will then generate a side-by-side comparison of the products, highlighting their similarities and differences. -->
